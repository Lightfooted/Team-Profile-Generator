  ## Description:
  This is an application that runs through the command-line and generates an HTML file. The user is prompted with questions on making a team of employees: Manager (default), Engineer or Intern. Each selected role is then prompted with additional questions to fill out. Each card displayed is color coded with the selected employee role. Other than the Manager, you can make multiple Engineers or Interns.
